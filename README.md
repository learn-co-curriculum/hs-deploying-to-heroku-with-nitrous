# Deploying to Heroku with Nitrous

Deploying an application means taking the code you’ve written on your computer (locally), and uploading it to a server that runs continuously, so that your application is accessible to anyone on the internet. The process of deploying and maintaining applications on servers is known as DevOps.

To deploy your Ruby application, we’re going to be using Heroku, a cloud-based server. Follow these steps to deploy your application using Heroku’s servers:

+ Sign up at heroku.com
+ In your terminal, run `gem install heroku`
+ Navigate to your project’s folder, and type `heroku create`
+ Add your heroic credentials and a name for your webapp.
+ Make sure you have added and committed your changes using git.
+ type `git push heroku master`
+ Sit back and smile OR Google your error!
